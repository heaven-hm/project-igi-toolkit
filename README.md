# Project I.G.I ToolKit

[Project I.G.I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_I.G.I.) ToolKit is all in one game toolkit which lets you edit all game objects including _Buildings/3D/AI/Weapons_ and lets you to design your own _custom level_ in the game and lets you _upload/download_ your level to server and share with your friends.

## Pre-Requisite
- **General section.**
- [DLL File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library) - This project uses [IGI Natives.dll](https://github.com/IGI-Research-Devs/IGI_Internal/) file and inject that into Game to call game native methods. .</br>
- [DLL Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_injection) - This project needs DLL injection into _IGI_ game.</br>
- **Game specific section.**
- [IGI Graphs Structure](https://github.com/IGI-Research-Devs/IGI-Research-Data/blob/main/Research/GRAPH/Graph-Structure.txt) - Project IGI 1 Graph structure data.
- [IGI 3D Models](https://github.com/IGI-Research-Devs/IGI-Research-Data/blob/main/Research/Natives/IGI-Models.txt) - Project IGI uses 3D models in 
form of _MEF_ (**M**esh **E**xternal **F**ile).
- [IGI Camera View](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Definition-of-pitch-roll-and-yaw-angle-for-camera-state-estimation_fig15_273225757) - IGI use game Camera called [Viewport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewport) to display the game.

## ToolKit components.
ToolKit has several components which it needs in order to work fully to its functionality.
- Server : Located at [OrgFree](http://igiresearchdevelopers.orgfree.com/) which contains Mission files and Resources like Weapon/A.I images for toolkit.
  - **⚠️ Server Issues**: The server might face connectivity issues or downtime. If you encounter problems:
    - **For Images**: Use the local "AppImages" folder provided with QEditor in the ToolKit package
    - **For Missions**: Upload/Download functionality may be unavailable during server downtime
- ~~Database : Located at Github Gist private repo contains privacy information like _I.P,Mac Address_ and _Key_ for ToolKit.~~
- Internal DLL : Located at [IGI-Internals](https://github.com/IGI-Research-Devs/IGI_Internal) is used to call IGI Game internal native methods.
- QEditor - Located at path `C:\Users\my_username\AppData\Roaming\QEditor`  This is appdata file comes pre-installed with any version of toolkit and can be downloaded from here [QEditor Full Version](https://www.mediafire.com/file/7ycvekb2l9fc7qr/QEditor.zip/file).</br>

## QEditor components.
**Q**Editor was the initial name of the project because editor actually modifies **Q** files of games like _QVM,QSC,QAS_ files but later it was changed.</br>

## ToolKit Working flow.
ToolKit most of the time just compiles the script file _QSC_ called _Q_ script source into _QVM_ called _Q_ virtual machine and Restart the level in order to see the affected changes. 
Here is workflow mentioned.
1. Get game level and select proper source file of level located at `QToolKit\QFiles\IGI_QSC\missions\location0\level`.</br>
2. Updates the script file with new script depends upon logic Add/Update/Delete commands.</br>
**Internal compiler**</br>
3. Copies script file from ToolKit `C:\IGI-ToolKit` to `D:\IGI\` and compiles them to binary _QVM_ file and moves them to proper destination.</br>
**External compiler**</br>
3. Copies script file from ToolKit `C:\IGI-ToolKit` to `QToolKit\QCompiler\Compile\input` and compiles them to binary _QVM_ file and convert compiled QVM v7 (IGI 2) to QVM v5 (IGI 1) using _DConv_ tool and moves them to proper destination.</br>
4. Restart the level and see the changes.</br>
